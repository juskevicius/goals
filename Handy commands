Starting a db with authentication:
cd Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin
mongod --auth --port 27017 --dbpath /data/db

mongo --port 27017 -u "myUserAdmin" -p "abc123" --authenticationDatabase "admin"


To do:


developement:
gauge chart:
disable 'edit current score' when it's calculated automatically

line chart:
edit entered scores

goal details:
edit goal details

nesting:
edit weights of children goals
current score is incorrect

hide weights of tasks if tasks are dedicated to children
spread tasks to see their implementation per child

Check hdata calculations and whether they should be initiated. 

production:
NODE_ENV
mongo - change IP to the one that the host uses

cookie session vs express session
